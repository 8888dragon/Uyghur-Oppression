# Uyghur-Oppression
The truth about human rights abuses in Xinjiang
The oppression of Muslims in Xinjiang continues despite China's denials. These documents are from the Xinjiang Police Academy. We are not meant to see them. They are official documents that talk about "forbidden" activities that lead to Uyghur oppression and imprisonment. They are the guidelines that the Chinese police use on a daily basis in Xinjiang. We have known about this treatment for years, yet they are still in place today. Why is China making legitimate and harmless expression of Islam illegal? To regard the as illegal is not right and has to change now! We need to keep showing what is really happening to the Uyghurs! We are standing up and doing the right thing by making sure the world knows what is happening. When will the international community see what is really happening and do the right thing? The UN must act now! FIGHT OPPRESSION OF THE UYGHURS!!
